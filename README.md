## 🗒️ Project Intro/Objective
This project is more for my own practice with data visualization, dashboarding, processing/cleaning, and prediction.

This project contains notebooks in which I attempted to predict the winner of RuPaul's Drag Race season 15 by using machine learning. This was done by using the data of winners in all the different franchises and countries. This project also contains a dashboard that attempts to summarize the data of **all** finalists in all the different franchises.

Other than that, this project is more for my own practice with data visualization, dashboarding, processing/cleaning, and prediction with a domain that I am familiar with.

## 📁 Project Description
### 📃 Project Overview
Tracking the the contestants' progress from the different franchises of RuPaul's Drag Race has been a weekly thing for me since March 2020. I enjoyed watching the show as well as recording the weekly placements of each contestant. Eventually, after so many franchises, I was able to build my own criteria on which contestestants would reach the finale of their season. 

As of April 2023, the dataset has more than 10 tabs for the different franchises, seasons, and countries - and it's still growing. 

Aside from manually entering each episode on a weekly basis, I wanted to take it a step further and apply what I've learned from my minor program in Data Science.

**I consider this as a culminating mini-final-project for myself.**


### 🗄️ Data Sources
*No webscraping of any kind was done to get this dataset*

#### [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1hEZoaFOyDHFZhsbAA92NiwUNwWSARch8tuG1OOz9tp0/edit#gid=788565485)
> This is where all the contestant progress is stored. Regardless of the franchise or country, their progress is recorded on a weekly basis.

#### [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul%27s_Drag_Race) and [Fandom](https://rupaulsdragrace.fandom.com/wiki/RuPaul%27s_Drag_Race_Wiki)
> Since watching all episodes of different countries would be a limitation for me (some franchises are not available or hard to get access to in the Philippines), I go to `Fandom` to check the contestant progress. After that, I check their placements and encode it into the `Google Sheet` tracker.
>Though unreliable for other cases, I use `Wikipedia` to cross-check any placements with `Fandom` and `YouTube`

#### [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@rupaulsdragrace)
> Since some franchises are hard to get access to from the Philippines, `YouTube` becomes an indicator for me to record and update the tracker. Additionally, in the event that I get skeptical with any of my sources, I get to see for myself if the said progress is justified based on the episode itself.

### 📝 Problems Faced
>* Gathering the winners and identifying the returning challenges
>* Doing the modeling and applying it to my datasets
>* Relearning Dash, HTML, and CSS or styling for Dash components (dbc)
>* Dealt with inconsistencies in the dataset
